In this project, I analyse the traffic accidents rates to understand how the circumstances of the road conditions affect the possibility of traffic accidents.
I created a logistic regression model to analyse if bad road conditions affect the accident severity. As accident severity (dependent variable) is a categorical variable, I used logistic regression. In addition, k-means clustering was performed to identify the different clusters of road users within the data (Cars, motorcycles, huge vehicles, and bicycles) 

From the model result, most of the accidents occurred when the road condition is dry. Therefore, it is important to enhance the enforcement of traffic laws, especially in accident-prone zones.
